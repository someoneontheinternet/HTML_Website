	        The Arctic Region is among the uttermost interesting places on Earth. The region is composed of three territories: Yukon, NorthWest Territory, Nunavut confederated on July 1870. The region contains a large amount of diversity in terrains, climates, culture, and wildlife. With the current population of around 75,249, the arctic region is only 8% of the population in Vancouver. However, with the region mainly focusing on mining as one of the most important aspects of their economy, the region is still productive. The region also has a contrasting climate since it is situated inland with freezing Atlantic air blowing across the region. Most of the time, the temperature is pretty extreme reaching -40C in the winter, while 25C in the Summer. During the summer time, the territory can attract ten’s of thousands of Tourist all around the world to view the beautiful scenery. Agriculture is not a huge part of the economy since permafrost covers a huge area of land rendering the upper north part extremely difficult to farm. Overall, the Arctics is still one of the most interesting places.

                The terrain of the arctic consists of many geographical features, including mountains, low-lying hills, some marshes (Hudson Bay and northern Winnipeg), tundra, packed ice, glaciers, many freshwater lakes, and densely packed forests, which are mainly concentrated in the south. The rock of the arctic consists of mainly sedimentary and igneous rock. Intrusive and metamorphic can also be present.  Mountains are mainly present on the “mainland” part of the territories, while the tundra covers most of the northern part of the territories, such as Baffin Island. Since over time many minerals have formed due to volcanic eruptions and lava flowing millions, even billions of years ago, Minerals include gold, zinc, iron, lead, quartz, diamonds and other valuable minerals. While some of the geography can be interesting, some can (to be honest) be boring. The tundra consist of almost nothing, being just low-lying hills that have rock and have permafrost, which is permanent frost that thaws a bit over the summer. Overall the terrain can be interesting, but can be boring also.

                The vegetation of the arctic is barer as you go north. The vegetation is mainly concentrated in the south. But, don’t get me wrong here. The vegetation consists of many trees, bushes, berries, grass, moss, and much more, especially trees.  The trees that subside the forests in the arctic are mainly coniferous. Such trees that are commonly found are pine, spruce, cedar, fir, and many more. Some deciduous trees that are seldom found are birch, mountain ash, and the most common flour is the fireweed, which grows in fertile soil left behind by lava. The most common moss is lichen, which grows on rocks found in the tundra. While this sounds bland, lichen is an important contributor to diets of local wildlife. Overall, the vegetation has a big variety, which is good for the ecosystem.

                While the terrain and vegetation of the arctic can be limited, the wildlife is not! There are many animals that reside in the arctic, from mammals to birds to even bacteria! Mammals include reindeer, polar bear, arctic fox, narwhal, walrus, seal, ox, moose, orca, and more. Birds include the snowy owl, Yellow-Billed Loon, Rock Ptarmigan, Peregrine Falcon, buff-breasted Sandpiper, steller’s eider, snow goose, ruddy turnstone, rock ptarmigan, and more. Fish include the Atlantic cod, salmon, trout, char, American eel, shrimp, krill, Greenland halibut, capelin, common sea snail, haddock, viviparous eelpout, pacific herring, pacific sleeper shark, nine-spine stickleback,  two- horn sculpin, and pink salmon. Overall, A LOT OF ANIMALS live in the arctic, and rely on the topography and vegetation necessary to live.

			The industry that was holding the entire Northwest Territory’s economy is Mining. The arctic alone holds more then one forth of the entire Earth’s hydrocarbon reserve (Oil and Natural Gases). Also the entire region is mineral rich, which generated ore than $2 Billion in 2015, so mining would be one of the biggest industry. One of the most profitable mine in the arctic region is surpisingly diamond mines. Other then that, Gold, Copper, Zinc, Iron, Oil, Natural Gas, Cadium, Nickel, Tungsten, and Uranium. Also, mines creates thousands of long term jobs and hundreds of short term or temerpory job as well.

					Most people know that the artic region is freezing cold, so agricultre is not possible up north, except the Maxjenzie Region. Before the days of industrial revolution, fur trades are one of the biggest industry before whaling took over. Shortly after, whales started to become endagered thus resulting in the ban of whaling. To this day, fishing still generate large amount of money. For instance it generated over $839,900 a year, but fish population is on the decress as well. Either the region is going sololy rely on mining, or its going to have huge problems in the upcoming future.

				The only social issue that the northern people are facing is that wealthy businessmen are walking into their turf trying to make a quick dollar while destroying the land and turning the vast miles of snow into an industrial ground. The people all around Canada have been trying to block pipelines that have been trying to go up in the BC and Alberta area but because we have a large population we can make a noise; in the smaller parts of Canada they can’t do what we can do. The government is running down the land but most of us won't even notices because nobody is blasting it on social media and they don’t have news reporters investigating to find out what’s going wrong. They are by themselves. Not only that but food prices are so crazy that the average person won't even be able to feed their family. It's to the point where it cost over $25 just for a bottle of Orange juice, or $20 for a carton of milk. The prices are unbelievable but they can’t do anything because there is no other option, everyone needs food. The northern people are stuck with these prices because nobody can change it and nobody will.

				The past few years the arctic has been a very important area in the talks of the future of natural resources, mostly oil because of its high value in the market. Geothermal energy has also been an option that the world has been considering. The field is open even more north of us but we still have a big part of it under the land of Canada. Furthermore, because of global warming, the thick layers of ice have been thawing meaning the option of using the ocean as a giant highway is becoming more and more possible. Now that we know the land is filled with oil, and that we have a way of transporting it to almost anywhere by sea. My estimate that follows most professional opinions is that Canada will go forth in the mining operations in the northern part of their country. By doing this we are opening more jobs in a less populated area giving growth to our economy. And this is only the tip of the iceberg, most of the area is untouched there is no real number of how much oil is accessible for us to take. And if we are going to compare our arctic to the Russian arctic we can expect more than just oil, other minerals like nickel, gold, silver, zinc platinum, cobalt, and more rare stuff that is revealing itself now that the permafrost is melting, things like fossils are appearing more and more. The only problem that we are currently facing is the amount of money that it cost to expand into a new area, first off you must set down your foundations and you must pay people to stay at camps. Won't be cheap because who wants to live in the middle of nowhere? But the Future in the Canadian Arctic will be crazy because of all the riches we have yet to unbury.
